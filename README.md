Overview:
The Scientific Equation Calculator is a Java-based console application that performs a variety of scientific calculations. It uses an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, featuring interfaces, data composition, and modular design. The program offers a menu-driven interface to compute values for several scientific equations.

Features
The program supports the following calculations:
